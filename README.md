# 🤖 TanzilGPT – My Interactive AI CV  

Welcome to **TanzilGPT**, an AI-powered version of my CV.

## 🚀 How It Works  
- The chatbot uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) trained on my:  
  - 📄 CV and professional background  
  - 📂 Projects and code from GitHub repositories  
  - 🔗 Portfolio and online presence  
- It uses this knowledge to answer questions with cited sources  
- It does **not** search the web or access private data — only what I've chosen to share

## 🎯 Why I Built This
